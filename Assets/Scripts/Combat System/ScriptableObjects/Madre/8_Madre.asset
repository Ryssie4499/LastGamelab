  rispostaGiusta: He will understand. He will grow up and understand
  risposteSbagliate:
  - "You woke up the boy, went to work, did some work at home\u2026it\u2019s all
    right"
  - "Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find the time express him your feelings"
  - You did everything, just take some time and find your balance
  - Relax, face the problem with them, you can do it
  - "It\u2019s ok to discuss with your husband. Be more open with him, talk."
  - You are over worrying again, calm down, you did nothing wrong
  - You should have some time for yourself, nothing bad about it
  - "When the time is right, you will talk to him and tell him what happened, it\u2019s
    ok"
  - Things happens, this is the right thing to do, you can still take care of him
